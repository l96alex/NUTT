For {111} and {110} surfaces activation energies of 253+18 and 174+12 kcal mol-1 (1159 + 75 and 728 + 50 kJ/mol) respectively have been obtained. Diamonds have also been heated in the temperature range of 1950 to 2200 °C under a pressure of 48 + 3 kbar (4.8 + 0.3 GPa) and an activation volume of about 10 cm3 mol-1 obtained for both {111} and {110} surfaces. It is proposed that the rate controlling process in the graphitization of diamond is the detachment of a single atom from the diamond surface. This is contrary to previous proposals in which the detachment of groups of atoms have been considered to be the rate-controlling process. In the present work, it is suggested that the rate-controlling step for graphitization is the detachment of a triply bonded atom from a {111} surface and of a doubly bonded atom from a {110} surface. }

	abstract={Diamond has the highest thermal conductivity of any known material at temperatures above {\textasciitilde} 100K. The purest natural diamond single crystals reported so far1,2 have a conductivity of 24--25 Wcm-1K-1 at 300K, compared to 4 for Cu and 1.5 for Si. Synthetic single crystals of diamond which are prepared3 with carbon isotopically enriched in 12C show even higher conductivity: 33 Wcm-1K-1. Such high values of thermal conductivity have attracted attention to the possibility of using diamond for thermal management of electronic devices with high local power levels.4,5 The availability of polycrystalline diamond wafers made by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), of quality which now approaches that of the best single-crystal diamond, has opened the door to many imaginative applications of this new material. Generally, two applications have been considered: 1) heat spreading by bonding the device to a larger piece of diamond, and 2) heat spreading by fabricating the device entirely within the bulk of the diamond, rather than in Si or another material. For applications in the first category, both natural and CVD diamond have already served as platforms for high-power diodes and solid-state lasers.4,5,6 The thermal conductivity of state-of-the-art CVD diamond7 is comparable to that of the best single-crystal diamond. Thus, the bottleneck for transferring heat away from the device is usually the thermal resistance at the interface between the device and the diamond, a subject which is in need of further research.8 The second category, the fabrication of devices within diamond, is hampered by the lack of a suitable electronic donor and, until recently, by the lack of CVD material of sufficient purity and crystalline perfection to satisfy even approximately the stringent electrical requirements for solid-state electronic materials. The thermal advantage of eliminating the interface between the doped, electrically-active regions and the higher-purity regions with higher thermal conductivity is obvious. However, data on the thermal conductivity of intentionally doped diamond is meager at the present time. One of the aims of this chapter is to suggest what might be expected when more measurements are available.},

The carrier concentration has been determined as a function of incident intensity for three harmonics of a Ti : sapphire laser (800, 400 and ). The results demonstrate that, in a wide range of laser fluences (up to those resulting in surface and bulk graphitisation), a well-defined multiphoton absorption prevails. We have estimated nonlinear absorption coefficients for pulsed radiation at (four-photon transition) and at 400 and (indirect and direct two-photon transitions, respectively). It has also been shown that, at any considerable path length of a femtosecond pulse in diamond (tens of microns or longer), the laser beam experiences a severe nonlinear transformation, determining the amount of energy absorbed by the lattice, which is important for the development of technology for diamond photostructuring by ultrashort pulses. The competition between wave packet self-focusing and the plasma defocusing effect is examined as a major mechanism governing the propagation of intense laser pulses in diamond.}

The present study introduces a number of experiments carried out to convert graphite under high-pressure conditions, showing a formation of stable phase of fullerene-type onions cross-linked by sp3-bonds in the 55–115 GPa pressure range instead of diamonds formation (even at temperature 2000–3000 K) and the already formed diamonds turn into carbon onions. Our results refute the widespread idea that diamonds can form at any pressure from 2.2 to 1000 GPa. The phase diagram built within this study allows us not only to explain the existing numerous experimental data on the formation of diamond from graphite, but also to make assumptions about the conditions of its growth in Earth’s crust.}

By focusing the laser beam through a microscope objective, we successfully wrote transparent, but visible, round-elliptical damage lines inside high-silica, borate, soda lime silicate, and fluorozirconate (ZBLAN) bulk glasses. Microellipsometer measurements of the damaged region in the pure and Ge-doped silica glasses showed a 0.01--0.035 refractive-index increase, depending on the radiation dose. The formation of several defects, including Si E$\prime$ or Ge E$\prime$ centers, nonbridging oxygen hole centers, and peroxy radicals, was also detected. These results suggest that multiphoton interactions occur in the glasses and that it may be possible to write three-dimensional optical circuits in bulk glasses with such a focused laser beam technique.},

Where experimental results exist, the theoretical predictions and experimental results are in excellent agreement. In the high electric field region inclusion of both bulk and boundary threshold energy effects is essential. The predictions were based on exact solutions in the nonlocalized ionization coefficient formulation developed by Okuto and Crowell who showed that ionization coefficients as usually understood are functions of both electric field and position in a device. Predictions for abrupt and p-i-n junctions in Ge, Si, GaAs and GaP are presented.}

	abstract = { It has long been known that the contact between a metal and a semiconductor has a resistance which varies, in many cases considerably, with the direction of the current. A well-known example is the copper-cuprous oxide rectifier, which consists of a copper plate on which a layer of cuprous oxide has been formed, the oxide being in contact with a lead plate. It is the purpose of this paper to criticize existing theories of this effect and to suggest a new one. In any crystal rectifier we have two contacts to consider; for instance, in the copper-oxide rectifier there is the contact between the copper and the oxide, and that between the oxide and the lead. We may say at once that a condition for rectification is that at least one of these contacts shall have a resistance which is not small compared with the resistance of the oxide layer; for any theory will give, in the limit of small voltages across the contact, equal resistances in both directions; it is necessary that a significant part of the fall in potential in the rectifier should occur at the contact. }

Experimental studies have demonstrated charge-carrier mobilities1 of >3000 cm2V−1s−1 and thermal conductivities2 >2000 Wm−1K−1. The material has been predicted to have a breakdown field strength in excess of 10 MVcm−1. These figures suggest that, providing a range of technical challenges can be overcome, diamond would be particularly well suited to operation as a semiconductor material wherever high frequencies, high powers, high temperatures or high voltages are required.}

abstract = {Ternary chalcopyrite compounds which may act as an absorber in thin films solar cells are mainly CuGaSe2, the CuInS2, CuInSe2 and the CuAlSe2. Because of their large optical absorption coefficient, a thickness of 1.5-2 microns is sufficient to absorb the useful portion of the solar spectrum. The most promising appears to be the CuInSe2 material, a 18.8\% efficiency is obtained by the solar cells based on this material. However, its low band gap (1,04ev) limits the open circuit voltage and thus the efficiency of the solar cell. In this work we present the application of this material in hybrid photovoltaic thermal collectors (PVT). For the determination of its electrical and thermal performance through the development of a heat balance that involves heat exchange between the different components of the collector. The results obtained show that we can have a thermal efficiency equal to (85.68\%) and an electrical efficiency of the order of (19.22\%) for our PVT collector based on CIS are better than the values obtained by PVT collector based on monocristallin silicon.}

Strongly oxidizing solutions involving sulfuric acid generate low concentrations of surface sulfur together with an oxide phase. However, in the case of an ammonium persulfate–sulfuric acid etchant solution, the Auger features associated with the diamond more closely resemble those of single crystal material suggesting that this treatment may offer better performance when used during the fabrication of thin‐film diamond electronic devices.}",

The best sample has shown a mobility of 240cm2/(Vs) at room temperature. The activation energy of the carrier was about 0.6eV. Hopping conductivity has not been observed for these samples as a dominant conduction mechanism even at room temperature, as confirmed by temperature-dependent Hall measurements. However, the carrier mobility shows a slow temperature dependence (∝∼T−0.7) even for the best sample; this implies the existence of another scattering mechanism with phonon scattering, which limits the carrier mobility at low temperature.}

The P-doped {111} homoepitaxial diamond thin films with n-type conduction are grown on high temperature high pressure diamond substrates by microwave-enhanced plasma chemical vapor deposition. The donor density and crystallinity of the phosphorus-doped diamond films were varied depending on the growth conditions. Metals with different work function and different reactivity to diamond films were deposited on the P-doped diamond films as electrodes. Ion implantation was also applied for introducing electrically active defects in diamond films. We found that n-type rectification properties with average Schottky barrier height of 2.4 eV were obtained from both Au and Cu contacts deposited on lightly doped diamond films with donor density ND of 5 × 1017 cm–3. Ohmic properties were obtained from electrodes on heavily doped layer with ND of over 1 × 1019 cm–3. Electrodes formed on the diamond film with electrically active defects also show Ohmic properties. These features indicate that the behavior of contacts formed on P-doped n-type diamond films is similar to those on typical n-type semiconductors.},

Gold contacts deposited directory on a lightly phosphorus-doped diamond showed a rectification characteristic, while those formed on the selectively grown, heavily doped diamond layers showed an Ohmic characteristic. The Ohmic property of contacts formed with the heavily doped layers was found to be independent of the metals. It is therefore concluded that the tunneling current dominates carrier transport at the interface between the metal and the heavily doped n-type diamond.}

    abstract = "{The value of the impurity-to-band activation energy EA of a dopant is a basic feature of the electrical conductivity of semiconductors. Various techniques were used to determine EA in n-type diamond doped with phosphorus, giving values of EA varying from 0.43 eV to 0.63 eV, the value EA of 0.6 eV being commonly accepted for the ionization energy of phosphorus donors in diamond. Nevertheless, up to now, the dispersion of the experimental values of EA remains unexplained. In this work, we investigate the electrical properties of a set of n-type diamond homoepitaxial films with different phosphorus concentrations by Hall effect measurements in order to deduce EA and to understand the evolution of this energy with the dopant concentration. We show that, below 2 × 1019 cm−3 phosphorus, the decrease of EA is mainly controlled by the concentration of ionized defects resulting from the donor compensation. The role of ionized defects in the decrease of EA is analyzed on the basis of existing models adapted to the case of diamond. The proposed model provides a correct description of the experimental data. It can be used to quantitatively predict the activation energy of phosphorus in n-type diamond for given donor and compensating acceptor concentrations.}",
